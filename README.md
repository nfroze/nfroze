# Hi, I'm Noah Frost

**Former Police Constable turned DevSecOps Engineer**, combining a background in criminology and law with hands-on experience in cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and secure software delivery.

## 🚀 What Drives Me

I'm passionate about building and securing systems the right way — from CI/CD pipelines to cloud deployments — and I believe in shift-left security, automation, and continuous learning to stay ahead of modern threats.

**These projects represent more than technical skills** — they're months of self-directed learning, built unpaid in my own time with no mentorship. Every bug fixed at 3am after 12-hour debugging sessions, every rebuilt infrastructure after Terraform state corruption, every successful integration after wrestling with Splunk parsing errors — all earned through pure persistence. From spiraling AWS costs to shipping GuardDuty logs, I pushed through every obstacle because I didn't just want to learn DevSecOps, I had to master it.

This portfolio demonstrates the same grit, passion, and ownership I'll bring to your team. When I commit to something, I deliver — whether that's protecting the public as a Police Constable or securing cloud infrastructure as a DevSecOps engineer.
