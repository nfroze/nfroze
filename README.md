# Hi, I'm Noah Frost

**Former Police Constable turned DevSecOps Engineer**, combining a background in criminology and law with hands-on experience in cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and secure software delivery.

I’m passionate about building and securing systems the right way — from CI/CD pipelines to cloud deployments — and I believe in shift-left security, automation, and continuous learning to stay ahead of modern threats.

## 🔐 DevSecOps Projects

### 🛠️ [Project 1: CI/CD Pipeline Security](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-1-CI-CD-Pipeline-Security)
- Built a secure GitHub Actions workflow integrating:
  - **SAST** with Semgrep  
  - **SCA** with npm audit  
  - **Secrets scanning** with Gitleaks  
- Prevented vulnerable or misconfigured code from being merged or deployed  
- Demonstrated shift-left security and fail-fast pipeline design

### 🐳 [Project 2: Image and Runtime Application Security](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-2-Image-and-Runtime-Application-Security)
- Built and scanned Docker images using **Trivy**
- Pushed secure images to Docker Hub and deployed to **Amazon ECS**
- Performed **DAST** using **OWASP ZAP** on the live ECS service
- IAM roles separated by least privilege for task and execution roles

### ☁️ [Project 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-3-Infrastructure-as-Code-IaC-Security)
- Used **Terraform** to provision secure AWS infrastructure (IAM, S3, EC2)
- Integrated **Checkov** into a two-step CI/CD pipeline (scan → deploy)
- Enforced least privilege IAM roles and secure state management via S3
- Automated misconfiguration checks during PRs to ensure secure-by-default deployments

### 🧠 [Project 4: Threat Modeling & Incident Response](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-4-Threat-Modeling-Incident-Response)
- Simulates a full threat modeling workshop for a fictional **enterprise-scale healthcare platform**
- Includes **HLD** and **DFD** diagrams to map architecture, data flows, and trust boundaries
- Applies the **STRIDE** threat model to assess control gaps across system components
- Maps attacker TTPs using the **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**
- Uses the **Cyber Kill Chain** to break down the lifecycle of several simulated attacks
- Conducts an **inherent risk assessment** to prioritize threats based on likelihood and impact
- Simulates a **NIST-aligned incident response plan** based on one modeled attack scenario

> 📌 This project is entirely independent from Project 5 and focuses exclusively on proactive security assessment for a large, fictional company.

### 📦 [Project 5: End-to-End DevSecOps Transformation](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-5---End-to-End-DevSecOps-Transformation)
- Builds and secures a lightweight Node.js web app to demonstrate full SDLC security
- Covers **cloud infrastructure**, **CI/CD**, **application security**, and **runtime protection**
- Provisioned with **Terraform** (AWS VPC, IAM, ECS)
- Implements a secure pipeline with:
  - **SAST**, **SCA**, **IaC scanning**, and **container scanning**
  - GitHub Actions for fully automated deployment and scanning
  - ECS deployment using secure Docker containers and IAM roles
- Uses **OWASP ZAP** for post-deployment dynamic scanning
- Focuses on realistic, scalable DevSecOps practices from infrastructure to production

> 📌 This project is not linked to Project 4 and serves as a standalone demonstration of hands-on DevSecOps implementation.

## 🚀 What Drives Me

Security is more than just a layer — it’s a mindset.  
I bring real-world discipline, technical curiosity, and a commitment to protecting systems just as I once protected people.
