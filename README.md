# Noah Frost | AI Infrastructure Engineer

I build AI infrastructure from the ground up.

## The Approach

Over 8 months, I designed and executed 20 cloud infrastructure projects using a systematic methodology I developed independently:

**How it works:**
- Research extensively until full contextual understanding is achieved
- Design architecture from first principles
- Build iteratively with checkpoint-based validation
- Document everything publicly for accountability

**AI as force multiplier:**
- Strategic direction stays with me: architecture, problem decomposition, quality decisions
- Tactical execution delegated to AI: code generation, research synthesis, documentation
- Result: compressed learning cycles and rapid delivery in unfamiliar domains

## Foundation

DevSecOps bootcamp graduate—6 weeks of security-first training from a Global CISO before building anything. Shift-left thinking from day one.

## Technical Stack

**Cloud Platforms:** AWS | Azure | GCP  
**Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform | Ansible | Helm  
**Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes | Docker | EKS | ECS  
**CI/CD & GitOps:** GitHub Actions | Jenkins | GitLab CI | ArgoCD  
**Observability:** Prometheus | Grafana | ELK Stack | Datadog  
**Security:** Checkov | Trivy | Semgrep | Gitleaks | OPA Gatekeeper  
**Languages:** Python | Bash | HCL  
**AI/ML:** MLflow | Model Context Protocol (MCP)
