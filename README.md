# Noah Frost | AI-Native Infrastructure Engineer

I don't just use AI tools. I've built a methodology for partnering with AI that accelerates everything I do.

## 🎯 The Approach

Over 8 months, I built 20 cloud infrastructure projects using a systematic methodology I developed myself:

**How it works:**
- I orchestrate, AI executes
- Strategic direction (systems design, problem decomposition, architecture) stays with me
- Tactical execution (code generation, research synthesis, documentation) is delegated to AI
- Every project starts with extensive research and thousands of "why" questions
- Theory → hands-on build → checkpoint → next challenge
- Everything documented publicly for accountability

**Why it matters:**
This isn't about using AI to write code faster. It's about building a symbiotic workflow that compounds learning velocity and execution speed. I passed three certifications purely from hands-on project work—no exam cramming. The methodology works.

## 🛡️ Foundation

DevSecOps bootcamp graduate—6 weeks of security-first training from a Global CISO before building anything. Shift-left thinking from day one.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

**Cloud Platforms:** AWS | Azure | GCP  
**Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform | Ansible | Helm  
**Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes | Docker | EKS | ECS  
**CI/CD & GitOps:** GitHub Actions | Jenkins | GitLab CI | ArgoCD  
**Observability:** Prometheus | Grafana | Elasticsearch | Kibana | Datadog  
**Security & Compliance:** Checkov | Trivy | Semgrep | Gitleaks | OPA Gatekeeper  
**Languages:** Python | Node.js | Bash | HCL  
**ML/AI Tooling:** MLflow | Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## 📊 Projects

## 🌍 Seeking Opportunities

I'm looking for opportunities in environments that value merit, capability, and innovation. The UAE's vision for technological excellence through global talent acquisition aligns perfectly with my approach to engineering.

After 8 months of building exactly what the market claims to need, I'm ready to contribute to a region that evaluates engineers based on what they can deliver, not demographics or traditional credentials.
