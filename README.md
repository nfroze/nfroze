# Hi, I'm Noah Frost

**Former Police Constable turned DevSecOps Engineer**, combining a background in criminology and law with hands-on experience in cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and secure software delivery.

I’m passionate about building and securing systems the right way — from CI/CD pipelines to cloud deployments — and I believe in shift-left security, automation, and continuous learning to stay ahead of modern threats.

## 🔐 DevSecOps Projects

### 🛠️ [Project 1: CI/CD Pipeline Security](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-1-CI-CD-Pipeline-Security)
![SAST](https://img.shields.io/badge/SAST-Semgrep-orange)
![Secrets](https://img.shields.io/badge/Secrets-Gitleaks-red)
![SCA](https://img.shields.io/badge/SCA-npm%20audit-blue)
![CI/CD](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI--CD-GitHub%20Actions-lightgrey)

- Built a secure pipeline integrating:
  - Static code analysis (**Semgrep**)
  - Software composition analysis (**npm audit**)
  - Secrets scanning (**Gitleaks**)
- Enforced fail-fast workflows to catch security issues early in development

### 🐳 [Project 2: Image and Runtime Application Security](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-2-Image-and-Runtime-Application-Security)
![Container Scan](https://img.shields.io/badge/Container%20Scan-Trivy-blue)
![DAST](https://img.shields.io/badge/DAST-ZAP-informational)
![CI/CD](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI--CD-GitHub%20Actions-lightgrey)

- Built and scanned Docker images using **Trivy**
- Deployed secure containers to **Amazon ECS** with least privilege IAM roles
- Performed **dynamic analysis** using **OWASP ZAP** on the live ECS service

### ☁️ [Project 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-3-Infrastructure-as-Code-IaC-Security)
![IaC Scan](https://img.shields.io/badge/IaC-Checkov-green)
![Terraform](https://img.shields.io/badge/IaC-Terraform-purple)
![CI/CD](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI--CD-GitHub%20Actions-lightgrey)

- Used **Terraform** to provision secure AWS infrastructure (IAM, S3, EC2)
- Integrated **Checkov** for automated misconfiguration detection
- Enforced security gate before cloud resources are deployed

### 🧠 [Project 4: Threat Modeling & Incident Response](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-4-Threat-Modeling-Incident-Response)
- Simulates a full threat modeling workshop for a fictional enterprise-scale healthcare platform
- Includes HLD and DFD diagrams to map architecture, data flows, and trust boundaries
- Applies the STRIDE threat model to assess control gaps across system components
- Maps attacker TTPs using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- Uses the Cyber Kill Chain to break down the lifecycle of several simulated attacks
- Conducts an inherent risk assessment to prioritize threats based on likelihood and impact
- Simulates a NIST-aligned incident response plan based on one modeled attack scenario

### 📦 [Project 5: End-to-End DevSecOps Transformation](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-5---End-to-End-DevSecOps-Transformation)
![SAST](https://img.shields.io/badge/SAST-Semgrep-orange)
![IaC](https://img.shields.io/badge/IaC-Checkov-green)
![Container](https://img.shields.io/badge/Container-Trivy-blue)
![DAST](https://img.shields.io/badge/DAST-ZAP-informational)
![CI/CD](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI--CD-GitHub%20Actions-lightgrey)

- Builds and secures a lightweight Node.js web app to demonstrate full SDLC security
- Covers cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, application security, and runtime protection
- Automates scanning at each stage (Semgrep, Trivy, Checkov, Gitleaks, ZAP)
- Uses GitHub Actions to orchestrate and enforce shift-left security workflows
- Deployed to AWS ECS via Terraform with hardened IAM configurations
- Applies threat-informed controls learned from Project 4

## 🚀 What Drives Me

Security is more than just a layer — it’s a mindset.  
I bring real-world discipline, technical curiosity, and a commitment to protecting systems just as I once protected people.
