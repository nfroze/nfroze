## üéì Certifications

AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner | CompTIA Security+ | HashiCorp Terraform Associate

All certifications earned through hands-on project work - passed first attempt without traditional exam preparation.

## üìà Development Methodology

I've developed a systematic approach to infrastructure engineering using AI as a force multiplier:
- **Strategic Direction:** I architect solutions, design systems, and solve problems
- **AI Collaboration:** LLMs handle code generation, multi-source research, and documentation
- **Outcome:** Accelerated learning cycles and production-quality delivery

This isn't about replacing engineering thinking - it's about amplifying productivity by delegating tactical execution while maintaining complete strategic control.
