# Noah Frost | AI Infrastructure Engineer

In a market where technology changes faster than people can specialise, I don't specialise — I adapt.

## The Point

I built 20 cloud infrastructure projects over 8 months. No mentor. No team. No templates. Designed my own curriculum, architected everything from scratch.

But the projects aren't the point. They're proof of something more valuable:

**I can learn anything, fast, without hand-holding.**

Drop me into an unfamiliar domain and I'll figure it out. Terraform will change. Kubernetes will evolve. New tools will emerge. That's not a threat — that's where I thrive. The technical skills are evidence. The adaptability is the product.

## The Method

AI is only as powerful as the person wielding it.

- **Strategic direction stays with me:** architecture, problem decomposition, quality decisions
- **Tactical execution gets delegated:** code generation, research synthesis, documentation
- **The result:** compressed learning cycles and rapid delivery in unfamiliar domains

Most engineers treat AI like a faster Stack Overflow. I treat it as a cognitive partner. The difference shows in the output.

## The Foundation

DevSecOps bootcamp graduate — 6 weeks of security-first training from a Global CISO before building anything. Shift-left thinking from day one.

## Technical Stack

**Cloud Platforms:** AWS | Azure | GCP  
**Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform | Ansible | Helm  
**Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes | Docker | EKS | ECS  
**CI/CD & GitOps:** GitHub Actions | Jenkins | GitLab CI | ArgoCD  
**Observability:** Prometheus | Grafana | ELK Stack | Datadog  
**Security:** Checkov | Trivy | Semgrep | Gitleaks | OPA Gatekeeper  
**Languages:** Python | Bash | HCL  
**AI/ML:** MLflow | Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Each project was designed, architected, and executed independently — no external templates.

## What Drives Me

My biggest fear is being wrong and not knowing it.

That's what's behind everything I build — research over assumption, evidence over ego, accountability over pride. Build fast. Fail faster. Admit defeat before anyone has to tell me.
