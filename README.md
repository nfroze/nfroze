# Hi, I'm Noah Frost

**Former Police Constable turned DevSecOps Engineer**, combining a background in criminology and law with hands-on experience in cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and secure software delivery.

## 🚀 What Drives Me

I'm passionate about building and securing systems the right way — from CI/CD pipelines to cloud deployments — and I believe in shift-left security, automation, and continuous learning to stay ahead of modern threats.

**These projects represent more than technical skills** — they're months of self-directed learning, built unpaid in my own time with no mentorship. Every bug fixed at 2am, every successful GuardDuty→Lambda→Splunk integration, every architecture decision was earned through pure persistence. I didn't just learn DevSecOps, I lived it.

This portfolio demonstrates the same grit, passion, and ownership I'll bring to your team. When I commit to something, I deliver — whether that's protecting the public as a Police Constable or securing cloud infrastructure as a DevSecOps engineer.

## 🔐 DevSecOps Projects

### 🛠️ [Project 1: CI/CD Pipeline Security](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-1-CI-CD-Pipeline-Security)

- Built a secure pipeline integrating:
 - SAST scanning (**Semgrep**)
 - SCA scanning (**npm audit**)
 - Secrets scanning (**Gitleaks**)
- Enforced fail-fast workflows to catch security issues early in development

### 🐳 [Project 2: Image and Runtime Application Security](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-2-Image-and-Runtime-Application-Security)

- Built and scanned Docker images using **Trivy**
- Deployed secure containers to **Amazon ECS** with least privilege IAM roles
- Used a **Load Balancer** to maintain a static IP for external access and scanning
- Performed **DAST** using **OWASP ZAP** on the live ECS service

### ☁️ [Project 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-3-Infrastructure-as-Code-IaC-Security)

- Used **Terraform** to provision secure AWS infrastructure (IAM, S3, EC2)
- Integrated **Checkov** for automated misconfiguration detection
- Automated terraform **init**, **plan**, and **apply** in a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Enforced security gate before cloud resources are deployed

### 🧠 [Project 4: Threat Modeling & Incident Response](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-4-Threat-Modeling-Incident-Response)

- Simulates a full threat modeling workshop for a fictional enterprise-scale healthcare platform
- Includes HLD and DFD diagrams to map architecture, data flows, and trust boundaries
- Applies the STRIDE threat model to assess control gaps across system components
- Maps attacker TTPs using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- Uses the Cyber Kill Chain to break down the lifecycle of several simulated attacks
- Conducts an inherent risk assessment to prioritize threats based on likelihood and impact
- Simulates a NIST-aligned incident response plan based on one modeled attack scenario

### 📦 [Project 5: End-to-End DevSecOps Transformation](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-5-End-to-End-DevSecOps-Transformation)

- Complete DevSecOps pipeline for Node.js app deployed to **Amazon EKS**
- Automated security scanning at every stage (SAST, DAST, SCA, IaC)
- **Security toolchain**: Semgrep, Trivy, Gitleaks, OWASP ZAP, Checkov
- Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform** (100% Checkov compliant)
- Runtime monitoring with **AWS GuardDuty** and **CloudWatch**
- Centralized security logging with **Splunk SIEM**
- Full CI/CD automation with **GitHub Actions**
- Implements security controls based on threat modeling from Project 4
