# Noah Frost

**DevSecOps Engineer** | Ex-Police Officer → Security-First Infrastructure

I learned DevSecOps with AI, not despite it. 8 months, 15 projects, zero tutorials—built alongside Claude and ChatGPT to understand *why*, not just *what*. Police background means I question everything, including AI output.
