# Hi, I'm Noah 👋

**DevSecOps Engineer** | Ex-Police Constable | Building secure cloud infrastructure

I build production systems. 20 projects in 8 months — multi-cloud orchestration, Kubernetes platforms, GitOps pipelines, automated security scanning.

My background: 18 months as a Metropolitan Police officer responding to critical incidents. Now I bring that incident response mindset to cloud security. Security clearance eligibility included.

**How I learn:** AI-accelerated, not AI-dependent. I use Claude and ChatGPT to understand documentation and debug problems faster — then build and test everything hands-on. Every architecture decision is intentional, every line of code understood.

### ⭐ Flagship Projects

| Project | Problem Solved | Tech Stack |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| [**Multi-Cloud Orchestration**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-20-Multi-Cloud-Orchestration) | Vendor lock-in makes cloud migrations expensive and risky. This deploys identical infrastructure to AWS, Azure, or GCP with one workflow. | Terraform, Ansible, Datadog, GitHub Actions |
| [**AI Developer Platform**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-17-AI-Developer-Platform) | New developers waste weeks finding docs and figuring out deployments. This centralizes everything in one platform. | Backstage, EKS/ECS, MLflow, ArgoCD, Helm, Terraform |
| [**DevSecOps Pipeline**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-5-DevSecOps-Pipeline) | Security vulnerabilities found in production cost 10x more to fix. This catches them before code ships. | EKS, Checkov, Trivy, Semgrep, Gitleaks, GuardDuty, Splunk |
| [**AI Governance Framework**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-19-AI-Governance-Framework) | Unapproved ML models slip into production without oversight. This blocks non-compliant deployments automatically. | Terraform Sentinel, OPA Gatekeeper, EKS |

### 🔒 Security & DevSecOps

| Project | Problem Solved | Tech Stack |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| [**MCP Security Ops**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-10-MCP-Security-Ops) | Incident response takes hours when humans are the first responder. This isolates threats in seconds, automatically. | MCP, GuardDuty, EventBridge, Lambda, Slack |
| [**MCP IaC Security**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-11-MCP-IaC-Security) | Security scanners tell you what's wrong, not how to fix it. This generates Terraform fixes from Checkov findings. | MCP, Checkov, Node.js, GitHub Actions |
| [**Container Security**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-2-Container-Security) | Container vulnerabilities hide in base images. This scans images before deployment and tests running apps for OWASP vulnerabilities. | Docker, Trivy, ECS, OWASP ZAP, ALB |
| [**IaC Security**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-3-IaC-Security) | Infrastructure misconfigs create security holes. This scans Terraform before apply and enforces least privilege. | Terraform, Checkov, IAM, GitHub Actions |
| [**Secure CI/CD**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-1-Secure-CI-CD) | Security scanning added as afterthought. This builds it into every push from the start. | GitHub Actions, Semgrep, npm audit, Gitleaks |
| [**Threat Modeling**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-4-Threat-Modeling) | Security assessments are ad-hoc and inconsistent. This applies STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK systematically. | STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, Risk Assessment |
| [**Live Threat Modeling**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-7-Live-Threat-Modeling) | Companies leak attack surface publicly without realizing. This demonstrates OSINT-based reconnaissance. | OSINT, Social Engineering vectors, Privacy Controls |

### 🚀 Platform & Infrastructure

| Project | Problem Solved | Tech Stack |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| [**AI FinOps Platform**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-18-AI-FinOps-Platform) | AI workloads create surprise cloud bills. This tracks GPU and API costs in real-time before the invoice arrives. | Kafka, Strimzi, OpenCost, Prometheus, Grafana |
| [**Observability Stack**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-15-Observability-Stack) | Incident diagnosis takes hours when logs, metrics, and alerts are scattered. This centralizes everything. | Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Fluentd, Prometheus, Grafana |
| [**3-Tier Serverless App**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-14-3-Tier-Serverless-Application) | Traditional backends require capacity planning and server maintenance. This scales automatically and costs nothing at zero traffic. | React, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Terraform |

### 🔄 GitOps & CI/CD

| Project | Problem Solved | Tech Stack |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| [**GitOps Monitoring**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-9-GitOps-ArgoCD-Monitoring) | Manual deployments are error-prone and hard to rollback. This makes Git the source of truth — revert a commit, revert the deployment. | ArgoCD, EKS, Prometheus, Grafana, Helm |
| [**CI/CD Comparison**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-13-CI-CD-Pipeline-Comparison) | Teams argue Jenkins vs GitLab CI without evidence. This implements both for the same app and compares them objectively. | Jenkins, GitLab CI, Terraform, Flask, Node.js |
| [**Portfolio Pipeline**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-16-Portfolio-Pipeline) | Manual deployments slow down iteration. This deploys on every push with automatic CDN cache invalidation. | GitHub Actions, S3, CloudFront, Terraform |

| [**Slack MCP Assistant**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-8-Slack-MCP-Assistant) | Important Slack messages get lost in noise. This searches and summarizes your workspace from Claude Desktop. | MCP, Slack API, Node.js |
| [**AI Chrome Extension**](https://github.com/nfroze/Project-6-AI-Chrome-Extension) | Long LinkedIn posts waste time. This summarizes them instantly and scores for spam. | Chrome Extension, Claude API, JavaScript |
