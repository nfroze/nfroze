## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Noah

I‚Äôm a **career-switching Cloud and AI Engineer** based in **Newcastle, UK**, focused on automation, security, and responsible AI adoption.  

Over the past eight months I‚Äôve **researched, designed, and built 20 original projects from scratch** across **AWS, Azure, and GCP**, using **Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines**, and a range of modern **security and monitoring tools**.  

I‚Äôve used **large language models** as my research partner and mentor - not to do the work for me, but to accelerate learning and deepen understanding. Every project here was built to explore real-world engineering practices, from **cloud infrastructure** and **DevSecOps automation** to **AI governance** and **multi-cloud orchestration**.  

These are all **learning projects**, built independently and continuously improved as I‚Äôve grown. They represent not just technical skills, but my mindset ‚Äî **structured, self-directed, and driven by curiosity**.  

üìç **Location:** Newcastle, UK

üì¨ **Open to:** Collaboration, feedback, and early-career opportunities in **cloud, platform, or AI engineering**
